## Display Technologies

### Aqueous Strippers

Aqueous-based strippers are environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional solvent-based strippers, used for removing photoresist and other residues in display manufacturing. Key advantages include reduced VOC emissions, high efficiency, material compatibility, cost-effectiveness, and improved safety.

### LTOC (Low-Temperature Organic Compound) for OLED

LTOC materials are crucial for forming thin-film layers in OLED displays.  They offer high transparency (98% at 400nm), precise resolution (10µm L&S), and rapid photo-speed (90mJ/cm²).  Used in flexible OLED touch panels and pixel-defined layers.

### Black Resist for OLED

Black resist materials create high-contrast OLED displays by blocking light leakage. Key features include high optical density (1.0/µm), standard developer compatibility (2.38% TMAH), and fine resolution (14µm hole).  Available in Cardo-based and Siloxane-based types.

### Photo-sensitive Polyimide (PSPI)

PSPIs combine the benefits of polyimides with photolithographic patterning.  Two types are available: conventional (g, h, i-line sensitive) and ULK (Ultra Low-K, Dk=2.7 @1MHz).

### High Thermal Stability Polyimide Resin

These resins are designed for applications needing exceptional thermal resistance and low CTE, crucial for flexible electronics.  LTPI-01 offers high thermal resistance (TD 5% = 576.96℃) and low CTE (4.13 ppm/℃).

### Micro-lens Array (MLA)

MLAs enhance light extraction in OLED displays.  Key features include g, h, i-line UV sensitivity, 2.38% TMAH development, and round shape pattern formation.

## Semiconductor Fabrication

### Bump Photoresist Remover

Designed for complete removal of photoresist in wafer bumping processes.  Features include compatibility with single spray & dip equipment, anti-corrosion for metals (Au, Ti, Cu), and removal of both positive and negative PR.

### Via Etch Post-Etch Residue (PER) Remover

Cleans residues after via etching, ensuring reliable connections.  Features include single spray & dip equipment compatibility and anti-corrosion for various metals (Au, Ti, Cu, Al).

### Negative Photo-sensitive Polyimide (for Semiconductor)

Used as a dielectric layer, offering excellent thermal and chemical stability.  Features include i-line UV patternability, solvent developability, and low-temperature cure (200℃).

## Ceramic Materials

### SOFC Solid Electrolyte 8-YSZ

8-YSZ (8 mol% Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia) is used as a solid electrolyte in SOFCs, offering high ionic conductivity. Key properties include white appearance, BET of 7±2 m²/g, and bending strength of 1000-1200 MPa.

### SOFC Metal Separator Development

Metal separators provide structural support, gas separation, and electrical conductivity in SOFC stacks. Key features include high electrical conductivity, low gas permeability, and stability in oxidizing/reducing environments.
